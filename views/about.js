  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Privacy Commitment: We Respect Your Data</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">At <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong>, we understand the importance of your personal information and we are committed to maintaining the highest level of privacy and security for our users. Unlike many job platforms that may exploit your data for profit, we believe in a <strong>privacy-first</strong> approach. Here’s how we ensure your information is safe and under your control:</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Transparency in Data Collection</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">We are fully transparent about the data we collect and why we collect it. When you interact with our platform, you will always know exactly what data is required and how it will be used. For example, personal details like your <strong>name, resume, and contact information</strong> are needed for job applications. On the other hand, <strong>optional information</strong> such as your social media profiles or personal preferences will only be requested if you choose to share them.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">No Hidden Data Harvesting</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">We don’t engage in unnecessary data harvesting. You should never feel like you’re being tricked into sharing more information than you intended. When you share your profile or resume with external platforms, like LinkedIn, it will always be a <strong>clear, explicit choice</strong>. We will never <strong>automatically share</strong> your data without your consent.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Say No to Dark Patterns</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">We’re fully committed to avoiding <strong>"dark patterns"</strong>, the deceptive design tactics that trick users into doing things they didn’t intend. For example, we <strong>never place</strong> data-sharing options, like the “share with LinkedIn” button, near sensitive fields such as Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) questionnaires. You’ll never accidentally share data unless you choose to.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Full Control Over Your Data</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">At any time, you can view, edit, or delete the personal information we store. You also have full control over whether or not your data is shared with third parties. For example, if you’d prefer not to share your profile or resume with external networks like LinkedIn, we make that <strong>clear</strong> and <strong>optional</strong>.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Separate Sensitive Data</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Your personal and sensitive information, including EEO data, will always be kept separate from optional data-sharing features. The EEO questions we ask are <strong>strictly for reporting purposes</strong> and do not influence your job application. You can skip these questions at any time without affecting your application.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">We Don’t Sell Your Data</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">We do not sell your data to third parties for advertising or any other purposes. Your data is used solely to provide you with the best possible experience on our platform and to help you in your job search. We take your privacy seriously and will <strong>never</strong> profit from selling or sharing your personal information with outside parties.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Encrypted Communications</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">We use <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong> to protect all communications between you and potential employers. This ensures that your messages, job applications, and sensitive information remain private and secure at all times.</p>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Privacy Features You Can Trust</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">We are building a platform that gives you full control over your data, while also ensuring it is <strong>secure</strong> and <strong>private</strong>:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Download, export, or delete your data</strong> at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous job applications</strong>: Apply to jobs without revealing your personal details until you’re ready.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy-conscious job listings</strong>: Employers won’t be able to see your information unless you’ve chosen to share it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-4">Our Promise to You</h3>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">We are not in the business of selling your data. Your privacy is a priority, and we are committed to providing a secure, transparent, and ethical platform for job seekers and employers alike.</p>
